Horiseon website for challenge 01
# Horiseon - Accessibility code fixes
## Description 

Horiseon's website needed to be made more accessible, so I was tasked to go through the code and make changes.
This included: Changing semantic tags within the HTML, linking the CSS, changing the structure to make it more logical, and completing fixes such as broken links.

I learned how to ensure the changes you make to an HTML are transferred to CSS, as well as how to make notes in code!
